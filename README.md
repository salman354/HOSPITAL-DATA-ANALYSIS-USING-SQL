# HOSPITAL-DATA-ANALYSIS-USING-SQL

- **Project Overview:** This repository contains SQL scripts and analysis performed on the patient dataset from Kaggle. The primary objective of this project is to analyze patient demographics, medical conditions, income levels, and survival rates to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the data.

- **Dataset:** The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle: [Dataset Used](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mitishaagarwal/patient)

- **Business Problem:**
Healthcare professionals are trying to identify the main causes of in-hospital mortality for admitted patients. By having a clear understanding of the causes early on, healthcare professionals will be in a better position to develop targeted interventions, and implement evidence-based protocols to address the factors that contribute to in-hospital patient deaths.

- **My Approach to Solving the Problem:**
  
To tackle the business problem of identifying the main causes of in-hospital mortality for admitted patients, I performed a comprehensive analysis leveraging SQL.My approach involved:

**1. Data Acquisition and Cleaning:**

  -Obtaining the dataset from Kaggle.
  
  -Importing it into Excel for initial cleaning and exploration.
  
  -Importing the cleaned data into MySQL for detailed analysis.
  

**2. SQL Analysis:**

-Conducting insightful queries to extract valuable information from the dataset.

-Exploring various patient attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, weight, BMI, heart rate, and comorbidities.

- **Conclusion:**
  
Age and comorbidities are significant predictors of in-hospital mortality. Advanced age is associated with higher mortality rates, and comorbidities like Diabetes significantly increase the risk. Heart rate and length of ICU stay are also important indicators.

- **Next Steps/Recommendations:**

While the dataset provided several good predictors for in-hospital mortality, it lacked other common factors that could influence patient mortality, such as specific treatments received, socioeconomic variables, and psychosocial factors. Future studies should strive to incorporate these additional variables for a more comprehensive analysis of in-hospital mortality.
